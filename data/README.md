# data files

My data files for each Advent of Code 2022 problem.
The `##_*.txt` files are my puzzle inputs.
The `example_*.txt` files are the examples included in the puzzle descriptions to see if the solution is working correctly.

*Note:* Every user has different data files.
The format is the same for all users, but the values are different.
If you participate in Advent of Code you would need to replace these files with the ones generated for you.
